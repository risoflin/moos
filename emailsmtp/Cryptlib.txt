The SSL/TLS capability of this example is provided by Cryptlib, an open source encryption
library. I have included the Cryptlib library cl32.dll, and msvcr100.dll which is a
Microsoft library that is used by some Cryptlib functions.

The cl32.dll library does not need to be registered, just available in the application
directory or in the system path. The msvcr100.dll library isn't actually used by the
Cryptlib functions being used. I included it because other functions do need it and
you may decide to use some of it's other capabilities.
